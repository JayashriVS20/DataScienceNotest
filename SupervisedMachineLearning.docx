   - Algorithm Type: Classification, Regression
   - Objective: Predict the class (classification) or value (regression) of a data point based on its K-nearest neighbors.

7. K-Means:
   - Algorithm Type: Clustering
   - Objective: Group data points into K clusters based on similarity.
   - How it Works: K-Means partitions the data into clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned cluster centroids.
   - Use Cases: Customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection.
   - Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index (for clustering quality)
   - Preprocessing Techniques: Feature scaling, handling missing values, choosing the optimal K.

8. Random Forest:
   - Algorithm Type: Ensemble Learning (Bagging)
   - Objective: Improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting.
   - How it Works: Random Forest consists of multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to make more robust and accurate predictions.

   - Objective: Reduce the number of features while preserving as much useful information as possible.
   - How They Work: Dimensionality reduction techniques transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation, often by finding new features that capture the most important variance.
   - Use Cases: Visualization, feature selection, improving model efficiency.
   - Evaluation Metrics: Not directly applicable; effectiveness is often assessed based on downstream model performance.
   - Preprocessing Techniques: Standardization, normalization, handling missing values.
   - Underfitting/Overfitting: Typically not prone to underfitting or overfitting, but it may lose some information during reduction.
