
1. Linear Regression:
   - Algorithm Type: Regression
   - Objective: Predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.
   - How it Works: Linear regression models the relationship between the target variable and predictors as a linear equation. It aims to find the line that best fits the data.
   - Use Cases: Predicting house prices, stock prices, temperature, etc.
   - Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Preprocessing Techniques: Feature scaling, handling missing values, feature engineering
   - Underfitting/Overfitting: Prone to underfitting if the model is too simple. Solution: Increase model complexity or use more features.

2. Logistic Regression:

   - Objective: Classify data into two or more classes.
   - How it Works: Logistic regression models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using a logistic (Sigmoid) function.
   - Use Cases: Binary classification tasks like spam detection, disease diagnosis, sentiment analysis.
   - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
   - Preprocessing Techniques: Feature scaling, handling class imbalance, one-hot encoding
   - Underfitting/Overfitting: Prone to underfitting if the model is too simple. Solution: Increase model complexity or use more features.

3. Decision Tree:
   - Algorithm Type: Classification, Regression
   - Objective: Create a tree-like structure to make decisions based on input features.

4. Support Vector Machines (SVM):
   - Algorithm Type: Classification, Regression
   - Objective: Find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes.

   - Preprocessing Techniques: Feature scaling, kernel selection, handling class imbalance
   - Underfitting/Overfitting: Prone to overfitting if the kernel is too complex. Solution: Use a simpler kernel or adjust regularization.

5. Naive Bayes:
   - Algorithm Type: Classification
   - Objective: Classify data points into classes based on probabilistic modeling.
   - How it Works: Naive Bayes assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label and uses Bayes' theorem to calculate probabilities.
   - Use Cases: Text classification (spam vs. not spam), sentiment analysis, document categorization.
   - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Preprocessing Techniques: Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords removal), feature engineering
   - Underfitting/Overfitting: Typically less prone to overfitting due to simplicity.

6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
   - Algorithm Type: Classification, Regression
   - Objective: Predict the class (classification) or value (regression) of a data point based on its K-nearest neighbors.
   - How it Works: KNN finds the K-nearest data points to the target point and assigns the majority class (classification) or averages their values (regression).
   - Use Cases: Customer segmentation, recommendation systems, and more.
   - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (regression)
   - Preprocessing Techniques: Feature scaling, handling missing values, determining the optimal K
   - Underfitting/Overfitting: Prone to underfitting with small K, overfitting with large K. Solution: Find an appropriate K.

7. Random Forest:
   - Algorithm Type: Ensemble Learning (Bagging)
   - Objective: Improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting.
   - How it Works: Random Forest consists of multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to make more robust and accurate predictions.
   - Use Cases: Classification and regression problems, such as predicting customer behavior, disease diagnosis, etc.
   - Evaluation Metrics: Gini Impurity (classification), Mean Squared Error (regression), Accuracy (classification)
   - Preprocessing Techniques: Feature scaling, handling missing values, hyperparameter tuning.
   - Underfitting/Overfitting: Less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.

8. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms:
   - Algorithm Types: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), etc.
   - Objective: Reduce the number of features while preserving as much useful information as possible.
   - How They Work: Dimensionality reduction techniques transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation, often by finding new features that capture the most important variance.
   - Use Cases: Visualization, feature selection, improving model efficiency.
   - Evaluation Metrics: Not directly applicable; effectiveness is often assessed based on downstream model performance.
   - Preprocessing Techniques: Standardization, normalization, handling missing values.
   - Underfitting/Overfitting: Typically not prone to underfitting or overfitting, but it may lose some information during reduction.

9. Gradient Boosting Algorithms:
    - Algorithm Types: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, etc.
    - Objective: Combine multiple weak learners to create a strong learner.
    - How They Work: Gradient boosting builds an additive model by training weak learners sequentially to correct the errors of the previous models.
    - Use Cases: Regression and classification problems, such as predicting click-through rates, customer churn, etc.
    - Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
    - Preprocessing Techniques: Feature scaling, handling missing values, hyperparameter tuning.
    - Underfitting/Overfitting: Prone to overfitting with complex models. Solutions include adjusting regularization, using simpler models, or early stopping.

10. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):
    - Algorithm Type: Ensemble Learning (Boosting)
    - Objective: Improve the classification performance of weak learners.
